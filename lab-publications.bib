              lifespans is an increased risk of developing cancer because
              organisms with long lifespans have more time to accumulate cancer-
              causing mutations than organisms with shorter lifespans. Indeed,
              while there is a strong correlation between lifespan and cancer
              risk within species, there is no correlation between maximum
              lifespan and cancer risk across species (‘Peto’s Paradox’). Here
              we use evolutionary genomics and comparative experimental biology
              to explore the mechanisms by which Bowhead whales (Balaena
              mysticetus), which can live at least 211 years, evolved their
              extremely long lifespans. We found that the Bowhead whale genome
              encodes a species-specific retroduplicated CDKN2C (p18INK4C) gene
              (CDKN2CRTG). The CDKN2CRTG gene is embedded within a Cetacean-
              specific LINE L1 element, and is highly expressed in Bowhead
              whale tissues likely because it coopted an L1 promoter to drive
              constitutive expression. Furthermore we use a series of gain of
              function experiments to show how the duplicate CDKN2CRTG gene may
              influence cellular phenotypes such as cell cycle progression and
              DNA damage repair in ways that are beneficial for aging and
              cancer resistance. Remarkably, Bowhead and Right whales only
              diverged ~4-5 million years ago, suggesting the long lifespan of
              Bowheads may have evolved relatively recently and coincident with
              the origin of CDKN2CRTG."

               health through their roles in coastal, benthic, and pelagic
               ecosystems. Marine mammals face escalating threats from climate
               change, pollution, and human activities, which perturb their
               oceanic environment. The diverse biology and extreme adaptations
               evolved by marine mammals make them important study subjects for
               understanding anthropogenic pressures on marine ecosystems.
               However, ethical and logistical constraints restrict the
               tractability of experimental research with live marine mammals.
               Additionally, studies on the effects of changing ocean
               environments are further complicated by intricate
               gene-environment interactions across populations and species.
               These obstacles can be overcome with a comprehensive strategy
               that involves a systems-level approach integrating genotype to
               phenotype using rigorously defined experimental conditions in
               vitro and ex vivo. A thorough analysis of the interactions

               anthropogenic pressures will enable robust predictions about how
               global environmental changes will affect their health and
               populations. In this perspective, we discuss four challenges of
               implementing such non-invasive approaches across scientific
               fields and international borders: 1) practical and ethical
               limitations of in vivo experimentation with marine mammals, 2)
               accessibility to relevant tissue samples and cell cultures; 3)
               open access to harmonized methods and datasets and 4) ethical and
               equitable research practices. Successful implementation of the
               proposed approach has the potential impact to inspire new

  abstract = "The rich species diversity of bats encompasses extraordinary
              adaptations, including extreme longevity and tolerance to
              infectious disease. While traditional approaches using genetic
              screens in model organisms have uncovered some fundamental
              processes underlying these traits, model organisms do not possess
              the variation required to understand the evolution of traits with
              complex genetic architectures. In contrast, the advent of genomics
              at tree-of-life scales enables us to study the genetic
              interactions underlying these processes by leveraging millions of
              years of evolutionary trial-and-error. Here, we use the rich
              species diversity of the genus Myotis - one of the longest-living
              clades of mammals - to study the evolution of longevity-associated
              traits and infectious disease using functional evolutionary
              genomics. We generated reference genome assemblies and cell lines
              for 8 closely-related (~11 MYA) species of Myotis rich in
              phenotypic and life history diversity. Using genome-wide screens
              of positive selection, analysis of structural variation and copy
              number variation, and functional experiments in primary cell
              lines, we identify new patterns of adaptation in longevity, cancer
              resistance, and viral interactions both within Myotis and across
              bats. We find that the rapid evolution of lifespan in Myotis has
              some of the most significant variations in cancer risk across
              mammals, and demonstrate a unique DNA damage response in the
              long-lived M. lucifugus using primary cell culture models.
              Furthermore, we find evidence of abundant adaptation in response
              to DNA viruses, but not RNA viruses, in Myotis and other bats.
              This is in contrast to these patterns of adaptation in humans,
              which might contribute to the importance of bats as a reservoir of
              zoonotic viruses. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of
              leveraging natural variation to understand the genomics of traits
              with implications for human health and suggest important
