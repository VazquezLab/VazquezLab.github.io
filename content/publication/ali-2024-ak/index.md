abstract: The ex situ population of the endangered black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes)
  has been experiencing declines in reproductive success over the past 30 years of
  human-managed care. A potential cause may be environmental-dependent inbreeding
  depression with diet being one of the contributing factors since ferrets are not
  fed their natural diet of prairie dogs. Here, we generated and analyzed semen proteome
  and transcriptome data from both wild and ex situ ferrets maintained on various
  diets. We identified 1757 proteins across all samples, with 149 proteins unique
  to the semen of wild ferrets and forming a ribosomal predicted protein-protein interaction
  cluster. Wild ferrets also differed from ex situ ferrets in their transcriptomic
  profile, showing enrichment in ribosomal RNA processing and potassium ion transport.
  Successful fertility outcomes documented for ex situ ferrets showed the strongest
  association with the semen transcriptome, with enrichment in genes involved in translation
  initiation and focal adhesion. Fertility also synergized with the effect of diet
  on differentially expressed transcriptomes, mainly affecting genes enriched in mitochondrial
  function. Our data and functional networks are important for understanding the causes
  and mechanisms of declining fertility in the ex situ ferret population and can be
  used as a resource for future conservation efforts.
