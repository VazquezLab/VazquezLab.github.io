 abstract = {Among the constraints on the evolution of remarkably long
lifespans is an increased risk of developing cancer because
organisms with long lifespans have more time to accumulate cancer-
causing mutations than organisms with shorter lifespans. Indeed,
while there is a strong correlation between lifespan and cancer
risk within species, there is no correlation between maximum
lifespan and cancer risk across species (‘Peto’s Paradox’). Here
we use evolutionary genomics and comparative experimental biology
to explore the mechanisms by which Bowhead whales (Balaena
mysticetus), which can live at least 211 years, evolved their
extremely long lifespans. We found that the Bowhead whale genome
encodes a species-specific retroduplicated CDKN2C (p18INK4C) gene
(CDKN2CRTG). The CDKN2CRTG gene is embedded within a Cetacean-
specific LINE L1 element, and is highly expressed in Bowhead
whale tissues likely because it coopted an L1 promoter to drive
constitutive expression. Furthermore we use a series of gain of
function experiments to show how the duplicate CDKN2CRTG gene may
influence cellular phenotypes such as cell cycle progression and
DNA damage repair in ways that are beneficial for aging and
cancer resistance. Remarkably, Bowhead and Right whales only
diverged ~4-5 million years ago, suggesting the long lifespan of
Bowheads may have evolved relatively recently and coincident with
the origin of CDKN2CRTG.},
