abstract: Among the constraints on the evolution of remarkably long lifespans is an
  increased risk of developing cancer because organisms with long lifespans have more
  time to accumulate cancer- causing mutations than organisms with shorter lifespans.
  Indeed, while there is a strong correlation between lifespan and cancer risk within
  species, there is no correlation between maximum lifespan and cancer risk across
  species (‘Peto’s Paradox’). Here we use evolutionary genomics and comparative experimental
  biology to explore the mechanisms by which Bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus),
  which can live at least 211 years, evolved their extremely long lifespans. We found
  that the Bowhead whale genome encodes a species-specific retroduplicated CDKN2C
  (p18INK4C) gene (CDKN2CRTG). The CDKN2CRTG gene is embedded within a Cetacean- specific
  LINE L1 element, and is highly expressed in Bowhead whale tissues likely because
  it coopted an L1 promoter to drive constitutive expression. Furthermore we use a
  series of gain of function experiments to show how the duplicate CDKN2CRTG gene
  may influence cellular phenotypes such as cell cycle progression and DNA damage
  repair in ways that are beneficial for aging and cancer resistance. Remarkably,
  Bowhead and Right whales only diverged ~4-5 million years ago, suggesting the long
  lifespan of Bowheads may have evolved relatively recently and coincident with the
  origin of CDKN2CRTG.
