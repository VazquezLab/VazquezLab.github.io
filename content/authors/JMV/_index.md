Juan Manuel Vazquez is a Puerto Rican biologist studying the evolution of exceptional longevity and healthspan in animals such as bats and whales. He employs a “farm-to-table” genomics approach that unites fieldwork, cellular and molecular biology, and functional population-scale genomics to tackle questions in aging across all levels of life. In addition to his research, he strives to eliminate all barriers to people’s success in STEM, and to democratize access to science through outreach and training programs.
