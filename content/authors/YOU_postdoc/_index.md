We're actively looking for new postdocs to join the lab! In addition to our actively funded [projects](/project), we also **strongly** encourage prospective postdocs with their own ideas to reach out early and collaborate on fellowship proposals!

We are currently seeking __two__ postdocs to help drive some of the core research projects in the lab: uncovering the complex genetic and structural variation landscape among [_Myotis_ bats using pangenomics](http://localhost:4321/project/myotis-pangenome/), and studying the evolution of [somatic mutations in bats](http://localhost:4321/project/somatic-mutations-bats/) and their underlying gene regulatory mechanisms. For the Pangenomics role, a background in population genetics and/or evolutionary biology is preferred; for the Somatic Mutations role, prior experience with either cancer genomics or with calling mutational signatures from sequencing data is preferred. For both roles, the ideal candidate will have previous experience with analyzing PacBio long-read sequencing data; experience with molecular and cellular biology techniques is a plus. 

If you are interested, applications must be submitted electronically and include a cover letter and a CV (including names of referees). Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until a suitable the position is filled.

_The Vazquez Lab is committed to advancing diversity and inclusion efforts at Penn State and we encourage individuals who identify as members of groups historically underrepresented in STEM to apply._
