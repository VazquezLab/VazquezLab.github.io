At the Vazquez Lab, we actively encourage any interested undergrads to reach out and learn more about what it's like to be a scientist! You can take a look at our [active projects](/project) for ideas, as well as read our [recent work here](/publication). The Vazquez Lab is a supportive environment: we are just as happy to have students come learn and help with ongoing experiments, as we are to help you follow your ideas and discover something unique! In general, we are looking for undergrads for the following roles:

- __Research Assistants__ work on small tasks that usually involve preparation, setup, and clean-up of materials. As part of their responsibilities, students will learn the basics of molecular and cellular biology and functional genomics while assisting graduate students and postdocs with experiments. Students also maintain the appearance of the labs and stockroom areas. __This is a great opportunity for students with [Federal Work Study](https://www.psu.edu/costs-aid/types-of-aid/federal-work-study)!__

- __Research Technicians__, or students interested in research for fun or class credits, will be responsible for assisting with experiments and research projects - or leading their own project! __Research is a full-time job__ - while the hours involved can be quite flexible depending on the project, students are expected to commit to at least 15-20 hours a week to lab work. We also strongly encourage interested students to explore the possibility of pursuing an [honor's thesis](https://science.psu.edu/bio/undergrad/schreyer-honors-college) while in the Vazquez Lab.

If you are interested in any of these options, or just want to learn more, feel free to contact us!
