We're actively looking for new grad students to join the lab! Prospective students are welcome to be a part of any of our [active projects](/project) - or to propose their own! The Vazquez Lab is a supportive environment, and we welcome folks with any expertise and allied interests to come join our group! 

The goal of the Vazquez Lab is to train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists. We encourage students to reject the paradigm of "learning more and more about less and less" that has become emblematic of science today. Similarly, we strongly encourage - and provide support for - students to broaden their horizons past academic science, and to embrace leadership roles in other facets of their daily lives - especially in scientific communication.

_The Vazquez Lab is committed to advancing diversity and inclusion efforts at Penn State and we encourage individuals who identify as members of groups historically underrepresented in STEM to apply._
