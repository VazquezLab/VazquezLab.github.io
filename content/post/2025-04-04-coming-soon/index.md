The Vazquez Lab will officially be opening its doors at Penn State University in __August 2025__! The lab will be studying the evolution of longevity-associated traits and the gene regulatory networks that govern them across extraordinarily long-lived mammals at all levels of life. 

The lab's strengths are highly interdisciplinary: we use a "farm-to-table genomics" approach combining field work and sampling, cellular and molecular biology, and functional genomics to study aging across all levels of life.

We're looking for grad students and postdocs! Feel free to [__take a tour__]({{< relref "/tour" >}}) of what our lab does, or [__read about our projects__]({{< relref "/project" >}}); we're especially excited to start studying the evolution of [__somatic mutations__]({{< relref "/project/somatic-mutations-bats" >}}) and of [__genetic structural variation__]({{< relref "/project/myotis-pangenome" >}}) across bats using long-read sequencing and pangenomics! If this sounds interesting to you, feel free to take a look at the links below and reach out!
